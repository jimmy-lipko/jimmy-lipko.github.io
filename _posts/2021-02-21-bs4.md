## Mining Job Positions for Skills

### How do differing jobs in the data science and engineering fields differ? 

For this post, I wanted to explore web scrapping from a high level. I previously heard good things about the bs4 library and decided to take it for a spin. 
The idea in this exercise is that each LinkedIn Job search returns about 25 results. If we can capture the search page, we can iterate over the result links. Then, we scrape the 25 jobs for their bulleted lists. These usually contain the requirements for the position. 

#### Import Libraries


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import requests
import urllib
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
First I'll define the backbone function in this post. I will create a function with one parameter: postion. This will be a string type argument of the name of the job position in question. I will use this position and concatenate it with the generic LinkedIn job search url to generate the job results page. From this page, I save only the links that lead to actual job descriptions, then iterate over this list of links and capture the bulleted lists on each JD. Lastly, the function returns only a pandas.DataFrame object with two columns -- "Words" and "Freq."

```python
def job_search(position):
    #Create LinkedIn Search from a predefined url formula. Here we have not set a location to search within
    # this could easily be added as another argument, but for now we want to return general results
    url = "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=" + urllib.parse.quote(position, safe='')
    result = requests.get(url)
    page_content = result.content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, 'lxml')
    
    #The "soup" contains the contents of the LinkedIn job search, using the method "find_all", we pass in "a" which
    # will return a list of links
    lists = soup.find_all("a")
    
    # We want to disgard everything but the links themselves, do do this we call the attribute method on 
    # each link and pass through "href"
    links = []
    for i in lists: 
        links = links + [i.attrs["href"]]
    
    #Because there are many links on the page, we need to narrow this list
    #We only want to capture the links that lead to job descriptions
    
    #LinkedIn job descriptions have the format "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view"
    l = []
    for li in links:
        if "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view" in li:
            l = l + [li] 
    
    #Lastly, we do not need all of the text on job descriptions. Instead, it's common for employers to list
    # the requirements for the position
    corpus = []
    for j in l:
        corpus = corpus + BeautifulSoup(requests.get(j).content, 'lxml').find_all("li")
        
    skills = []
    for items in corpus:
        if "_" not in items and "-" not in items and "https" not in items and "</h" not in items: 
            skills = skills + [items.text.lower()] 
    
    words = [word for p in list(dict.fromkeys(skills)) for word in p.split()]
    
    
    position_words = list(p.lower() for p in position.split())
    
    final_list = []
    for i in words:
        if len(i) < 12 and i not in ([input,'ability', 'skills', 'months', 'job','experience', 'new','years', 'york,','week', 'francisco,','ca2','ca3','ca1', 'diego,', 'days','weeks','jobs', "-","agoapply", "/",'ago', "angeles,", "," "ago", "&","Now","i", "me", "my", "myself", "we", "our", "ours", "ourselves", "you", "your", "yours", "yourself", "yourselves", "he", "him", "his", "himself", "she", "her", "hers", "herself", "it", "its", "itself", "they", "them", "their", "theirs", "themselves", "what", "which", "who", "whom", "this", "that", "these", "those", "am", "is", "are", "was", "were", "be", "been", "being", "have", "has", "had", "having", "do", "does", "did", "doing", "a", "an", "the", "and", "but", "if", "or", "because", "as", "until", "while", "of", "at", "by", "for", "with", "about", "against", "between", "into", "through", "during", "before", "after", "above", "below", "to", "from", "up", "down", "in", "out", "on", "off", "over", "under", "again", "further", "then", "once", "here", "there", "when", "where", "why", "how", "all", "any", "both", "each", "few", "more", "most", "other", "some", "such", "no", "nor", "not", "only", "own", "same", "so", "than", "too", "very", "s", "t", "can", "will", "just", "don", "should", "now"] + position_words):
            final_list = final_list + [i]
            
            
    # Creating an empty dictionary  
    freq = {} 
    
    for item in final_list: 
        if (item in freq): 
            freq[item] += 1
        else: 
            freq[item] = 1
            
    data = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(CountFrequency(final_list), orient='index', columns = ['Freq'])
    data = data.sort_values(by=['Freq'], ascending=False)
    data.index.name = 'Words'
    data.reset_index(inplace=True)
            
    return data
        
```
Now I can pass in job names to the function job_search. This will yield a dataframe of the keywords associated with it. For this post, I will compare and contrast 3 job titles: Machine Learning Engineer, Business Intelligence Analyst, Product Data Scientist.

```python
input = "Machine Learning Engineer"
input2 = "Business Intelligence Analyst"
input3 = "Product Data Scientist"
MLE = job_search(input)
BIE = job_search(input2)
PDS = job_search(input3)

```
Next, I will use a barchart to showcase the most popular words associated with each job title. 

```python
MLE.head(10).plot.bar(x='Words', y='Freq', rot=0)
plt.xticks(rotation = 45) 
plt.show
```




    <function matplotlib.pyplot.show(*args, **kw)>



<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/output_7_1.png" alt="">



```python
BIE.head(10).plot.bar(x='Words', y='Freq', rot=0, color = 'red')
plt.xticks(rotation = 45) 
plt.show
```




    <function matplotlib.pyplot.show(*args, **kw)>



<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/output_8_1.png" alt="">




```python
PDS.head(10).plot.bar(x='Words', y='Freq', rot=0, color = 'green')
plt.xticks(rotation = 45) 
plt.show
```




    <function matplotlib.pyplot.show(*args, **kw)>



<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/output_9_1.png" alt="">


I think that these results are fairly interesting. Any words that belong to the job description, I removed from the commensurate dataframe. Yet, 'data' and 'scientist' appear in the top words associated with M.L.E. and 'machine' and 'learning' are associated with P.D.S. Few programming languages associated with data science appear, with only java appearing with the more production heavy position of a Machine Learning Engineer. Tableau and Power BI, BI tools, appears in buisness intelligence engineer, suggesting that this varies from the other two positions.
