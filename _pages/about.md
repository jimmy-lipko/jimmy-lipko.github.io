Hey there! Thanks for visiting my data science portfolio. I hope that you find it interesting and learning something from the projects page. If you have any questions on the projects, have suggestions for improvements, or just want to say hello, feel free to send me an email, listed on the left side of the page.

My name is Jimmy Lipko. I grew up in Northeastern Pennsylvania where I enjoyed hunting, hiking, boating, and campfires. I then left the area and attended [Fairfield University](www.fairfield.edu) in Fairfield, CT, majoring in Mathematics and Minoring in Economics. Some of my favorite  classes included Number Theory, Econometrics, Industrial Organization, and History of the Middle East. At Fairfield, I also enjoyed my time as a Resident Assistant, where I made great friends and assisted underclassmen. 

Currently, I am working as a data science associate at a tech startup in South Norwalk, Connecticut. I focus on predictive modeling and neural nets to predict churn rate. 

In my free time, I love watching sports. I am a die-hard Yankees, Steelers, Penguins, and Notre Dame football fan. There is a reason for the geographical variety in my favorite teams, but I will leave it to you to ask that question. I enjoy trips to the beach during the summertime with Cape May, NJ taking home the number 1 spot on that list.

Computer Science and Mathematics have not always been my favorite classes or subjects, but they always have challenged me in a fun manner. I particularly like the challenge of coming up with the playbook (or algorithm) for the solution. I believe that this sequential manner of problem solving through logic is applicable to so many aspects of life, not only the Cs and math disciplines. 

My career aspirations are to remain on the East coast and work for a large technology firm. I am most interested in convolutional neural networks and I seek to explore them in greater detail using this website.
