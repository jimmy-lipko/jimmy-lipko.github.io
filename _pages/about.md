From a young age, I have always been interested in applied mathematics and computer science. At Fairfield University a degree in Math and minor in Economics transformed my interests into data science and business intelligence skills. As my aptitude has grown, so has my passion to apply them in business settings. As employee 9 of a startup social media company I built a data science team of 3 , deploying cloud solutions and creating company dashboards across all verticals. In contrast, my experience at UBS and Amazon Robotics is focused on much more granular projects that demand high precision and cross-functional collaboration.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, skiing, fitness, golfing, going to the beach, and enjoying an IPA. I am always happy to talk with other data enthusiasts and learn about the latest and greatest technologies.
