My name is Jimmy Lipko and I am currently a senior data science at a tech startup in South Norwalk, Connecticut. As part of my job, I work with ML algorithms to predict and analyze various areas of our business. I also work with correlation matricies, pairplots, PCA, and other data wrangling tools to understand and process the company's data. I have experience with hypothesis testing techinques to gauge the success of marketing campaigns, specifically A/B testing using a two-tailed t-test. I have also been tasked with building out and maintaining dashboards for all verticals of the business with Tableau. 

I do the majority of my analysis in R and in Python. I produce most data visualizations with ggplot, plotly, or tableau. 

I am trained under the idea that data analysis is nothing without proper communication of the analysis. I have experience with presenting my data reports to both executive teams and high net worth investors, and also to and those at the associate/entry level. I have done this with Tableau stories and dashboards, excel charts, powerpoints, academic papers, and demonstrations.

I graduated in the winter of 2019 from Fairfield University in Fairfield, CT. While at Fairfield, I majored in Math and minored in Economics. My favorite classes were Number Theory, Econometrics, Industrial Organization, Real Analysis, and both of my math honors seminar courses - 5 Proofs of the Fundamental Theory of Algebra and Crytography.

In addition to my undergraduate education, I have learned much from my work experience. I interned at UBS in the wealth management division. I learned everything I now know about finance due to this internship and due to my boss, who was and still is an amazing mentor. I am very interested in the blend of the two disciplines of finance and data science and I wish to share some of the projects I have explored in these areas on this site. 

Computer Science and Mathematics have not always been my favorite classes or subjects, but they always have challenged me in a fun manner. I particularly like the challenge of coming up with the playbook (or algorithm) for the solution. I believe that this sequential manner of problem solving through logic is applicable to so many aspects of life, not only the CS and math disciplines. 

My career aspirations are to remain on the East coast and work for a large technology firm. I am most interested in growing with a team, first by learning and listening, then understanding, and finally by reporting and optimizing.
